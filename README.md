# PingFederate Certificate Expiration Report Creator

## üìù About
This script was developed as a personal project in my home Ping Identity home lab as a way to learn the Ping Federate API. I formerly had this in a private Python repo but decided to move it to its own public repo.  It is licensed under the MIT License to ensure maximum usability for anyone who finds it helpful.  This script was created entirely on my own time and resources, independent of my professional role.

## üéØ Script Purpose

The `pingfed-cert-report.py` script is a utility designed to generate detailed reports on the certificates used in a PingFederate environment. It interacts with the PingFederate Admin API to retrieve certificate data, analyze expiration details, and produce customizable reports. Key features include:

- **Certificate Types Supported**:
  - SSO signing certificates
  - SSL server certificates
  - CA certificates
  - SP (Service Provider) connection certificates
  - IDP (Identity Provider) connection certificates

- **Output Options**:
  - Reports can include JSON and/or CSV attachments, or no attachments, based on user preference.
  - Certificates are sorted by expiration date for clarity.

- **Customization and Extensibility**:
  - Ability to specify PingFederate instance details, API credentials, and admin email recipients.
  - Integration of expiration details and organizational information into the reports.

- **Error Handling and Validation**:
  - Ensures the existence of required CA certificate files.
  - Provides informative messages for missing or incorrect configurations.

This script is ideal for administrators and engineers who need to monitor certificate expiration proactively and ensure uninterrupted operation of their PingFederate deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Python Version 
The script requires **Python 3.6+** üêç
- `logging`, `logging.handlers` (built-in)
- `requests` and `requests.auth` (requires installation)
- `json` (built-in)
- `subprocess` (built-in)
- `email.mime.text`, `email.mime.multipart` (built-in)
- `datetime` (built-in)
- `argparse` (built-in)
- `getpass` (built-in)
- `signal` (built-in)
- `os` and `sys` (built-in)

Make sure to install all necessary dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests
```
### CA Certificate Configuration
The `ca_cert_file` variable must be set to the path of the CA certificate file on the local system. This certificate is used to validate the SSL connection to the PingFederate API. Below are common paths for CA certificate files on supported Linux systems:

- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8/9**:
  - `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`
  - `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`

- **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04**:
  - `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
  - `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/<custom-ca>.crt`

### Example Configuration
Update the `ca_cert_file` variable in the script as shown below:
```python
ca_cert_file = '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'  # Example for Ubuntu
```

If your system uses a non-standard or custom path and/or file for the CA certificate, ensure the correct path and file name is specified and the file is accessible to the script.
